    <p class="osmtContent"><em>A step-by-step guide and helpful tips for users to complete the core tasks within OSMT.</em></p>

    <div class="collapsible">Starting a Local OSMT</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>OSMT is server-based software, but you can try it out locally with OSMT's Quickstart. This local installation is for evaluation purposes. You can export RSDs and Collections, but the database behind a local Quickstart should be considered "temporary".</p>
        <p>The actual installation of a production OSMT might look different for every organizartion. WGU and the OSMT community are actively working on ways for organizations to deploy "permanent" production OSMT instances, including what we would call "reference architectures" -- prescriptive models that could be used by multiple customers within a given cloud provider's environment. Please follow and engage with this <a href="https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt/issues/123" target="_blank">Issue</a> in our GitHub.</p>
        <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
        <p>To start OSMT using the Quickstart, you will need <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a> installed, with at least 6GB allocated to Docker. More memory will be better.</p>
        <ul class="info-callout">
            <h3>Running OSMT Quickstart on Windows</h3>
            <li>Installing Docker on Windows is a manageable task, but it is not a simple double-click installation. Starting OSMT Quickstart is simpler in MacOS or in Linux. If you are a Windows user, you can install Docker with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Starting OSMT Quickstart will be done by entering commands and running BASH scripts in a "terminal" window. MacOS and Linux support this natively. In Windows, you can use "Git Bash", which comes installed with git.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Running OSMT Quickstart</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a "terminal" window, and create a directory for OSMT source code, and <code>cd</code> into it. Download the OSMT source code repo with this command:
                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt.git</code></pre>
                Then cd into OSMT's project directory (just created by git)
                <pre><code>cd osmt</code></pre>
                <h4>Using the OSMT CLI utility (osmt_cli.sh)</h4>
                <ul class="info-callout">
                    <li>The OSMT source code includes a utility named <code>osmt_cli.sh</code>; this simplifies setting up an OSMT environment and doing routine tasks. You can run via a terminal window, from the OSMT git repo's root directory. Run this command to see the help output:
                        <pre><code>./osmt_cli.sh -h</code></pre>
                        If you are using Windows, and having trouble running this help command, please see the <a href="https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt/discussions/131" target="_blank">"Running OSMT Quickstart from Windows"</a> thread in the <a href="https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt/discussions" target="_blank">Discussion</a> area.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Obtain a "free developer" Okta account. Please follow the steps in <a href="https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt/blob/develop/README.md#oauth2-and-okta-configuration" target="_blank"> OAuth2 and Okta Configuration</a>, and return here when complete.
                <ul class="info-callout">
                    <li>If your organization uses Okta for other purposes, please note that this Okta account is completely separate from any other Okta accounts or logins you may have.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Initialize your environment files by running this command:
                <pre><code>./osmt_cli.sh -i</code></pre>
                Next, edit the osmt-quickstart.env file and replace the 'xxxxxx' values with the correct values from your Okta account.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the Quickstart configuration. This will take several minutes to download resources and build the software. If you continue to loop on errors that report "Retrying in 10 seconds...", there's something wrong.
                Search and reach out in the <a href="https://github.com/wgu-opensource/osmt/discussions" target="_blank">Discussion</a> boards in GitHub.
                <pre><code>./osmt_cli.sh -q</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. You will be prompted to log in to OSMT using Okta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pressing [Ctrl]+C in your terminal window will stop the Quickstart. You can restart it and resume your evaluation. Please take care to use Quickstart only for evaulation purposes. You can export whatever RSDs and Collections you create in Quickstart.

    <div class="collapsible">Add Skills to OSMT: How to Batch Import</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>When first accessing OSMT, there will not be any skills in the library.</p>
        <p>To add skills, it is recommended to use the &lsquo;Batch Import&rsquo; feature.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Click the &lsquo;Batch Import RSDs&rsquo; button under the primary RSD/Collections search bar.</li>
        <li>To batch import, be certain to use the most current CSV template.
            Either drag the Microsoft Excel CSV file containing the RSD data to the upload space or click &lsquo;select a file to upload&rsquo; from the local device.</li>
        <li>Confirm the file is the correct file for RSD data import.</li>
        <li>Click &lsquo;Next&rsquo; to continue.</li>
        <li>The RSD properties from the CSV file will be mapped and prepared for batch import. Note that the file can be confirmed (or changed) from this screen. There is also a preview to the total number of RSDs included for batch import.</li>
        <li>RSD fields, or CSV File Properties need to be confirmed and realigned if necessary.
            Click the drop-down arrow and select the correct &lsquo;Map to Property&rsquo; if necessary.
            <p class="info-callout">
                    An extra step needs to be taken to map Occupation codes upon batch import. The Occupational Major Groups, Occupational Minor Groups, Broad Occupations, and O*NET Job Codes need to be manually mapped to &lsquo;Occupations.&rsquo; Click the drop-down arrow and select &lsquo;Occupations&rsquo; from the list for RSD aligned fields.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Once the &lsquo;CSV File Property&rsquo; and &lsquo;Map to Property&rsquo; fields are aligned, click &lsquo;Next&rsquo; to import the RSDs to OSMT for review.</li>
        <li>The RSDs initially imported from the CSV files are listed for review and validation prior to importing into OSMT.
            Once RSDs are validated and errors corrected (if any are identified), click &lsquo;Import&rsquo; to add the RSDs to the OSN Pilot instance of OSMT.</li>
        <li>Pop-up will briefly appear at the top of the screen confirming the successful import of RSDs to the library.
        <p>From here, you can view the library, import more RSDs, or use any of the features available in OSMT to create or edit individual RSDs, publish RSDs, conduct a basic or Advanced search, view existing Collections, or Create a Collection.
            Upon importing, it is recommended to View RSD Library.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Although RSDs have been imported to OSMT, they are imported in draft form, meaning they are not publicly viewable with a unique URL. RSDs may be published individually, by selecting several RSDs to publish (using the radio buttons and ellipses for options), or by adding new RSDs to a Collection and publishing the complete Collection with RSDs.
        <p>For the purpose of this guide, RSDs will be added to a Collection and published in that manner. Prior to adding RSDs to a Collection, a Collection must be created. View the next section of the guide for creating a Collection, adding RSDs, and publishing the Collection and RSDs.</p>

    <div class="collapsible">Create a Collection and Add Skills to a Collection</div>
    <div class="content">
        <ol>
        <li>Before adding RSDs to a Collection, the Collection must first be created. Click the &lsquo;Create Collection&rsquo; button to get started.</li>
        <li>Add the Collection name and Author of the Collection.
            <p class="margin-zero"> <em>Note:</em> The Collection Name is required to search to add RSDs to the Collection. Take note of what you name the new Collection so it can be searched for easily.</p></li>
        <li>Click &lsquo;Save&rsquo; to create the Collection.</li>
        <li>Once the Collection is created, note that it is in draft form, meaning it is not publicly viewable with a unique URL.
            For the purpose of this guide, RSDs will be added to a Collection and the RSD and Collection will be published simultaneously.
            Click &lsquo;Add RSDs To This Collection&rsquo; to add the recently imported RSDs to the Collection.</li>
        <li>RSDs in the OSMT library need to be searched for to be added to a collection. RSDs may be searched for individually in the search bar or using the Advanced Search feature.
            For purposes of the pilot, it is recommended to use the &lsquo;Advanced Search&rsquo; to curate the RSDs that were batch imported.
            Click &lsquo;Advanced Search&rsquo; to continue.</li>
        <li>The Advanced Search feature offers specific searching for all RSD fields.
            For purposes of the pilot, it is recommended to search by &lsquo;Author.&rsquo; Once search criteria is entered, click &lsquo;Search RSDs&rsquo; to complete the search.</li>
        <li>Review the list of RSDs yielded from the Advanced search. RSDs need to be selected in order to be added to a collection.
            The &lsquo;Select All&rsquo; button may be selected to select all RSDs yielded from the search, or RSDs may be selected individual using the radio buttons.</li>
        <li>Type in the name of the Collection that was created for the RSDs and press the enter (return) key to search for the collection.</li>
        <li>Click &lsquo;Select Collection&rsquo; next to the Collection to add the selected RSDs to the Collection.</li>
        <li>A pop-up will briefly appear at the top of the screen confirming the successful addition of RSDs to the Collection.
            Next, the Collection and associated RSDs need to be published so they are publicly viewable and assigned a URL.
            To return to the Collection, click the &lsquo;Collections&rsquo; button at the top of the OSN OSMT Page.</li>
        <li>Locate the Collection to be published in the Collections list.
            If the Collection is not immediately listed on the Collections page, search for the Collection name using the Search Bar or the Advanced Search function.
            Click the name of the Collection to view the Collection details.</li>
        <li>Review the draft RSDs in the draft Collection. Once the RSDs in the Collection are confirmed, click &lsquo;Publish Collection.&rsquo;</li>
        <li>An alert will appear that the Collection contains draft RSDs. To publish the RSDs along with the collection, click &lsquo;Yes, Publish RSDs and Collection.&rsquo;</li>
        <li>Pop-up will briefly appear at the top of the screen confirming the successful publication of the Collection.</li>
        <li>The Collection and RSDs are now published! From here, the URL can be copied and shared, a CSV version of the collection may be downloaded, and the JSON can be copied.
            Individual RSDs can also be publicly viewed and shared. To view an individual RSD, click the RSD short name.
            Additional tasks may be completed at the individual RSD level, such as editing, copying, viewing the published RSD, and archiving.</li>

    <div class="collapsible">Create a Single RSD</div>
    <div class="content">
        <ol>
        <li>There may be instances where a single RSD needs to be added to OSMT.
            From any screen in OSMT, click on the &lsquo;Create RSD&rsquo; button under the primary search bar.</li>

        <li>Enter the RSD fields on the Create Rich Skill Descriptor page.
