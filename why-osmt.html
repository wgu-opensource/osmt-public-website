<div class="colorBand"><div class="wrapper">

<h2>Reduce Costs</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Almost all skill data is not machine actionable, making it expensive and difficult for organizations to use or create skills-based tools or resources.</p>

<h2>Support Adoption</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Data providers and users need an accessible way to collectively shift to skills as currency.</p>

<h2>Interoperability</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">A common skills language allows learners and workers to share skills to attain jobs and gain entry into education/training programs.</p>

<h2>Career Mobility</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Learners and workers need to connect what they know and are able to do to their education and employment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Speed-up Change</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Employers need to be able to quickly up- or re-skill employees in response to market change.</p>

<h2>Efficient Credentialing</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Manual or outdated processes for issuing and verifying resumes, CVs, and transcripts lose employers and educators time and money.</p>

<h2>Accurate Validation</h2>
<p class="osmtContent">Academic credentials don’t say anything about someone’s knowledge and skills. Rather, in-demand workforce skills should be tracked, linked to work performance, and mapped to curricula.</p>
